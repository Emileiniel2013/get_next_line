This is the complete and working version of the get_next_line project from 42 Heilbronn. The function extracts the first line encountered in an fd, with a given BUFFER_SIZE, and keeps a static linked list that remembers the last line that it was taken from the fd, so that it can get the next line/lines on the next call/calls. Works on any type of file/text layout. I would be happy with anyone that checks out my code and learns something from it, as I also did :D
